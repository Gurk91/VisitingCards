# VisitingCards

A simple iOS app that allows you to organize photos of your visiting cards.

My first ever iOS app, initial version completed on 16th Jan 2020 on Swift 4.2 using Xcode 10. Over the next few weeks and months I intend to add more functionality to this and make it more useful.

I will also be migrating the project to Swift 5.0 as soon as I am done downloading Xcode 11.
